| [thisopenspace](https://thisopenspace.com) | thisopenspace is a marketplace for connecting brands with short term space rentals. We're used by companies to do retail pop-ups, photoshoots, meetings, etc. Our team is around 15 people right now. Our app was written in rails with templates/jquery. We are embedding our templates with a lot of root-level react components instead of continuing along that path. The nature of our component trees are quite shallow and difficult to coordinate due our non-spa style refactor. Mobx definitely made things simpler as opposed to adding extra abstraction and complexity like other frameworks. | ![logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/673901/27930095-39f215ce-624a-11e7-89e1-79b25cfa0289.png) |
